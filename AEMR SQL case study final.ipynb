In the workplace, you're going to have to grow familiar with googling and searching for functions that you may have not learned or be familiar with. In this question, to identify the TOP `Description_Of_Outage` reason for each Participant, you're going to need to use `PARTITION BY`. You can read all about the approach you can take in this example <a href = \"https://learnsql.com/cookbook/how-to-rank-rows-within-a-partition-in-sql/#:~:text=To%20partition%20rows%20and%20rank,rank%20rows%20within%20a%20partition.\"> here </a>.
